# Support Wheel of Fate

## Frontend

  Run via the `npm start` command from the fronend folder

## Backend
  
  Run via the `node .` command from the backend folder ( or `node main.js` )
  
  
The frontend gets the data from backend on load so make sure you refresh the page if you started the frontend first
